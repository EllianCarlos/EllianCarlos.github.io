# Tools Needed

You just need nix with nix flakes enabled. I cannot tell you how to run this with nix flakes yet because although I'm using, I'm still learning.

# Developing

To start developing is as easy as doing a:
```sh
nix develop
```

Then to create a production build `pnpm run build` and to create a server watching the changes `pnpm run start`
