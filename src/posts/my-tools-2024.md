I love testing and using new tools, in this year I've decided I'm gonna give it a go to many different tools and programs that I've always wanted to try and discover. I've been having an incredible experience and mostly been having fun configuring and setting up my environments.

## What I've been using in 2024?

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) for declarative builds and reproducible environments.
- [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) on xwayland as my Desktop Environment. With [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), [Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) and the [Hypr Ecossystem](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [Lazy Vim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) as my developer environment.
- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/) for Kotlin and Java development.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/new/) and [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/).
- [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
