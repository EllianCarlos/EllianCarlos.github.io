    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      Hi there, ðŸ‘‹! My name is Ellian Carlos. I'm a brazillian software engineer, math and information systems student. I'm also a husband to a loving wife and a son to loving parents!
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm a Software Developer Engineer at the AtoZ company, and a bachelors in Information Systems at the ICMC, an institue of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I love languages, both the humans and the computer ones. Right now, I'm working with Kotlin, TypeScript, Python and others. I'm learning Kotlin, Typescript and Python. I want to learn Rust someday! I also know some C/C++.
      About the human languages, I'm fluent in Portuguese and English. I'm learning Spanish and Japanese and I want to learn Mandarim and German someday.
      Besides the languages I'm working with I also use Docker, AWS and SQL in my everyday work.
      </p>
      <p>
      I can't emphasize how much I like studying, I love to dive deep into technical details and to get lost into mathmatical representations of world and computers.
      I am curious about almost everything, also I don't have a specific type of learning, I like pratical or theorical things, readings, lectures or on hands projects, everything is valid.
      </p>
      <p> 
      I want in the future to pursue a Master's Degree in a Computational Field highly connected to mathmatics, so If you have a cool project or paper and want to colaborate, <s> give me a call</s> e-mail me!
      </p>
    <h3> My Beliefs </h3>
      <p> 
      I believe that the world is built by people and for people. I believe that all education and knowledge should be free to all and with equal oportunity to access. 
      I also believe that we all are keepers of the world and ourselves and we should honor that.
      </p>
      <p>
      As a Software Engineer I believe that we have an indirect impact on the world by the applications we build and resources we use.
      This can have many implications, some are to be frugal with energy resources and to provide acessibility as a must in all ours application.
